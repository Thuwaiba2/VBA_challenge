# VBA_challenge
In this challenge i used the given data to generate yearlychange, perscntage change and total stock volume.
I used codes from class to generate the last code "lastrow=Cells(Rows.count, 1).End(xlUp).Row"
Then i wrote  a code referencing ("Interior.ColorIndex") from a code in class to fill cells with color for negative and positive value. for this i tried using "negative" and "positive" but they didnt work. I tried using less than "0" and greate than "0" but i wasnt succesful with tthat too. in module 2 but i font know why that hasnt worked
I was not able to generate a code that will work for the greatest increase and and decrease and greatest total volume. Itried to use the maximum and minimum function
